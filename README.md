Etch a sketch is some kind of game where you have a grid which can be painted. Very funny(trust me).
Also I wanna try editing github readme with different styles so _yes_.

**Website is linked in "about" section.**

# TODO:
```
1. Upgrade multiple tool selection (selecting other tool when its clicked and unselecting current selected)
2. Fix black square appearing after the first click(optional)
3. Better optimization (reduce lag)
```
(there is a lot can be done but im leaving it as it is for now)

Here is website link(in case you don't know where "about" section is): [Fancy modern website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab_channel=RickAstley)
